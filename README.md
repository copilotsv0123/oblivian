## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- PostgreSQL database (we recommend [Neon](https://neon.tech))

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sderosiaux/oblivian.git
cd oblivian
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Set up environment variables**
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` with your configuration:
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."  # Your Neon PostgreSQL connection string
JWT_SECRET="your-secret-key"     # Generate a secure random string
# Optional: configure external embedding providers
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
OPENAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL="text-embedding-3-small"
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-api-key"
ANTHROPIC_EMBEDDING_MODEL="claude-3-5-haiku-embed"
EMBEDDING_PROVIDER="openai"      # openai | anthropic | local
```

4. **Initialize the database**
```bash
npm run db:push
```

5. **Start the development server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see your app running! üéâ

### Deployment

The app is configured for automatic deployment on Vercel:

1. Push to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard
4. Deploy automatically on every push to main

## ü§ñ Claude Desktop Integration

Oblivian integrates with Claude Desktop using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for AI-powered card generation.

### Setup MCP

1. **Create an API token** in the Settings page after logging in

2. **Configure Claude Desktop** by adding to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "oblivian": {
      "command": "/opt/homebrew/bin/npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://oblivian.vercel.app/api/mcp",
        "--header",
        "Authorization: Bearer ${OBLIVIAN_TOKEN}"
      ],
      "env": {
        "OBLIVIAN_TOKEN": "YOUR_API_TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `YOUR_API_TOKEN` with the token from Settings.

3. **Restart Claude Desktop** and start generating cards with natural language:
   - "Create 20 flashcards about Python programming"
   - "Generate cards for learning Spanish vocabulary with advanced notes"
   - "Make a deck about World War II with explanations"

### MCP Tools Available
- `list_decks` - View all your decks
- `create_deck` - Create new decks with title, description, level, and language
- `update_deck` - Update deck properties (title, description, level, language, visibility)
- `delete_deck` - Delete a deck and all its cards
- `create_cards_batch` - Generate multiple cards at once with advanced notes
- `list_cards` - Browse cards in a deck
- `update_card` - Edit a single card's content
- `update_cards_batch` - Update multiple cards at once
- `delete_card` - Remove a single card
- `delete_cards_batch` - Delete multiple cards at once
- `get_api_info` - Get information about the API connection

## üìö Documentation

### Creating Cards

#### Manual Creation
1. Navigate to a deck
2. Click "Add Card"
3. Choose card type and enter content
4. Add advanced notes for deeper insights
5. Save and start studying

#### AI Generation with Claude
